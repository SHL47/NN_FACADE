# Building Facade Extraction from Street View Images

In this project, I focus on extracting building facades from street view imagery using the University of Central Florida's Google Street View dataset, which includes 62,058 images from Pittsburgh, Orlando, and parts of Manhattan. To address variations in environmental conditions like weather and lighting, I implement a [Deep White-Balance Editing](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Afifi_Deep_White-Balance_Editing_CVPR_2020_paper.html) approach, by Afifi and Brown. For the main task of facade extraction, I utilize the [kMaX-DeepLab model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04044) by Yu et al., which is designed for precise image segmentation tasks.
